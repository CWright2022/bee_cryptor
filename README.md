# bee_cryptor
A fun project re-born from an old HS project. Encrypts text using the Bee Movie script (or any other multi-line) text of your choosing. Also the much better successor to bcrypt.

## Usage
Run bee_cryptor.py to be presented with a very basic CLI. Basic form is to enter an option, then enter input.
### Options
e - encrypt user-provided text  
d - decrypt user-provided text  
ef - encrypt from file  
df - decrypt from file  
w - change wordlist (default is script.txt)  
x - exit
