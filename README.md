# bee_cryptor
A fun project re-bornfrom an old HS project. Encrypts text using the Bee Movie script (or any other multi-line) text of your choosing

Run bee_cryptor.py, then type e for encrypt, d for decrypt, x for exit, and w to change "word list" (by default, this is script.txt)

Note: running multiple rounds will crash your computer due to the fact that one letter is transformed to one word, and so on...
